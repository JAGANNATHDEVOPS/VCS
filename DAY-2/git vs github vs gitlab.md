**Git:**

1. Type: Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).
2. Functionality: Git is the core version control system that allows you to track changes in source code during software development. It is a command-line tool that provides the fundamental features needed for version control, such as committing changes, branching, merging, and more.
3. Client-Server Model: Git follows a decentralized or distributed model. Developers have local copies (clones) of the repository, and changes can be synchronized between these copies.

**GitHub:**

1. Type: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
2. Functionality: GitHub is a platform built around Git, offering a web interface to interact with Git repositories. It adds features such as pull requests, issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools. GitHub is widely used for hosting open source projects and facilitating collaboration among developers.
3. Collaboration: GitHub is a centralized service where developers can host their Git repositories, collaborate on projects, and contribute to open source software.

**GitLab:**

1. Type: GitLab is another web-based platform for managing Git repositories.
2. Functionality: Like GitHub, GitLab provides hosting for Git repositories with additional features. GitLab includes tools for continuous integration, continuous deployment, code review, issue tracking, and more. It aims to be a comprehensive platform for the entire software development lifecycle.
3. Deployment Options: GitLab can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure, providing flexibility in terms of where your repositories are hosted.

**Key Differences:**

1. GitHub and GitLab are both web-based platforms, while Git is the underlying version control system.
2. GitHub is often used for hosting open source projects, whereas GitLab is known for providing more comprehensive DevOps features.
3. GitLab offers the flexibility of being self-hosted, while GitHub primarily operates as a cloud-based service.
4. GitHub and GitLab have their own unique features and workflows, such as GitHub Actions in GitHub and built-in CI/CD tools in GitLab.
5. In summary, Git is the version control system, GitHub and GitLab are platforms built around Git with additional collaboration and project management features, and GitLab provides a more comprehensive set of tools for the entire software development lifecycle. The choice between GitHub and GitLab often depends on specific project requirements and team preferences.
